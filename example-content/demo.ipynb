The tactical goals are for students to use the basic tools of computational thinking to write small scale programs and to use a vocabulary of computational tools to understand programs written by others.', 'How are grades calculated in the course?': '55% of the grade is from problem sets and 45% is from the quizzes (10%, 15%, and 20%) and a final exam.', 'How are quizzes and exams administered (e.g., open book)?': 'The quizzes are open book and open note.', 'Are there any textbooks required for the course?': 'There is no required text.', 'What are the expectations regarding lecture and recitation attendance?': 'N/A', 'Why are class notes not handed out?': 'Class notes are not handed out because taking notes is valuable for learning, as the process exercises both halves of the brain.', 'How is the course structured (lectures, recitations, workload)?': 'Lectures and recitations are part of the course structure, and attendance to recitations is expected.', 'What does it mean to think like a computer scientist?': 'It means having the ability to think in computational modes of thought.', 'What is computation?': 'Computation is addressed by separating out the mechanism, the computer, from computational thinking.', 'What is the difference between declarative and imperative knowledge?': 'Declarative knowledge tells you what something is, while imperative knowledge tells you how to deduce something.', 'How do we capture imperative knowledge in a computer?': 'N/A', 'What is a fixed-program computer?': 'A fixed-program computer is a piece of circuitry designed to do a specific computation.', 'What is the significance of Alan Turingâ€™s work to computation?': 'Alan Turing, one of the great computer scientists of all time, created the bombe, which was designed to break codes and used during WWII to break German Enigma codes.', 'What is a stored-program computer?': 'A stored-program computer has a memory connected to a control unit and an arithmetic logic unit (ALU).
