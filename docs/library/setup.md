##Â API Key Setup

In order to make use of the Gemini models, an API key must first be generated. Instructions for generating an API key can be found below, taking notes from [Patrick Loeber's Build with Gemini Workshop](https://github.com/patrickloeber/workshop-build-with-gemini/tree/main).

1. Visit [Google AI Studio](https://aistudio.google.com/apikey) to create or retrieve an API key.
2. Copy the API Key and save it called `GEMINI_API_KEY` for use in your project. In Google Colab this can be saved as a secret or in local development it can be saved as an environment variable using `export GEMINI_API_KEY=<your_key>`. In this guide the key is stored in a `.env` file as follows:
`GEMINI_API_KEY="<your_key>"`
It is important that you do not share this key in publicly available code.
