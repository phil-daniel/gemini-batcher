    "# Gemini API: Batching\n",
    "\n",
    "Batching describes the process of combining multiple individual API calls together into a single API call. Imagine you need to buy three things from a shop, rather than going to the shop three separate times, buying one item each time, it would be more efficient to only go to the shop once, getting everything you need. The technique can provide multiple benefits, including:\n",
    "* Reduced latency - Rather than having to make repeated HTTP calls, only a single one must be made, reducing latency. In addition, since many LLM APIs have rate limits, the number of requests which can be made may be limited. \n",
    "* Improved cost efficiency - In some situations, combining your inputs into a single API call can reduce the number of tokens required. For example, given a paragraph costing 400 tokens to process, and 5 questions each costing 10 tokens, asking the questions one at a time would take ≈ (400 + 10) * 5 = 2050 tokens, whereas batching the questions would only take ≈ 400 + (10 * 5) = 450 tokens, giving a signficant improvement. An example of this is shown below."
